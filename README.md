## :book:&nbsp; Overview

This is home to my personal Kubernetes clusters. [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches this Git repository and makes the changes to my clusters based on the YAML manifests.

For more information, head on over to my [docs](https://docs.buvis.net).

## :handshake:&nbsp; Community

Thanks to all the people who donate their time to the [Kubernetes @Home](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/) community.
